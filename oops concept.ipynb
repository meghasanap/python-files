    "Hiding complex implementation and showing only necessary details\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. This way developers hide unnecessary implementation details and expose only the relevant functionalities. For example, users of Tpoint Tech may find the content easy to understand, but they are unaware of the processes involved in gathering, organizing, and publishing it.\n",

    "Importance of Abstraction in Python\n",
    "Abstraction allows programmers to hide complex implementation details while displaying the users only the essential data and functions. Data abstraction helps making it easier in order to design modular as well as properly structured code. It also helps simplifying the understanding and maintenance of the program, promoting the reusability of code and improving the developer collaboration."
